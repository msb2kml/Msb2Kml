# Installation

The application should be compiled from the sources of this
repository or downloaded from the
["Releases"](https://github.com/msb2kml/Msb2Kml/releases) pages.  
The application package (such as Msb2KmlXX.apk) should be transferred 
to the storage of the device (such as Downloads).  
Selecting it with a File Manager should offer the opportunity to install it.

Other applications should be installed for a better experience;
they are all frees.
